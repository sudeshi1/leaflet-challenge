# Leaflet Challenge: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

* The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. 
* Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 
* The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data.
* They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. 
* Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet.

### Step 2

- Used [World Tectonic Plates & Boundaries](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates) to add a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently
